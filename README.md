<h3>Colour analysis of images from Instagram posts with hashtag #selfcare</h3>

<br>

This project, firstly, aims to analyse high-level colour patterns from Instagram posts tagged with hashtag
[`#selfcare`](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/selfcare/). Secondly, the project analyses colour patterns from Instagram posts that are tagged with some of the most commonly used hashtags. (MILLORAR)

## Data
![](results/collage.jpg)

For this experiment, 2 datasets have been created. One containing images from Instagram tagged with #selfcare and the other containing generic Instagram images. 

### #selfcare dataset

This created dataset containes **3526 images** with #selfcare. The images have been retrieved mostly from the following days:
- 2021-01-07
- 2021-01-08
- 2021-01-10

However, other dates are also present. Details on the date occurences can be found in [this file](results/stats_dates.csv).

### generic dataset

This dataset contains **3562 images** from generic hashtags, such as: `#tbt`, `#followme`, `#repost`, `#photooftheday`, `#picoftheday`, `#follow`, `#like4like`, `#nature`, `#instagood`, `#instadaily`, `#instagram`, `#happy`. We deemed that the images tagged with these 12 hashtags present a wide variety of imagery that may be representative of Instagram as a whole. The hashtags have been obtained from [this list of the most used Instagram hashtags](https://influencermarketinghub.com/most-popular-instagram-hashtags/).

## Results

### Palette
The following palette was found as the most descriptive for the dataset (10 colours). More details on the colours are
found in [this file](results/palette_rgb_codes.csv).

The following bar plot, illustrates the relevance of each palette component along with the corresponding RGB code.

The higher the bar, the more presence it had in the dataset.

### Palette generic IG post
Below I illustrate the palette for a generic post in Instagram.

## Use the code
The core code of the project lives in folder [scripts](scripts), where multiple scripts are found. 
### Installation
Make sure to have [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

_This project was developed using Python 3.8_

### Prepare the dataset
#### Download images
Use the script [`download_images.py`](scripts/download_images.py). By default, images are stored under `data/original`
(make sure it exists).

```
$ python scripts/download_images.py
```

#### Process images
Use the script [`process_images.py`](scripts/process_images.py). By default, images are stored under `data/processed`
(make sure it exists).

```
$ python scripts/process_images.py
```

This script resizes the images to 224x224 pixels. In order to minimize the impact of resizing (it can lead to noticeable
distortions), only near-squared images have been used.

### Build data collage
Use the script [`build_collage.py`](scripts/build_collage.py).

```
$ python scripts/build_collage.py
```

By default, the generted collage is stored as
[results/collage.jpg](results/collage.jpg).

### Obtain palette
Use the script [`get_palette.py`](scripts/build_collage.py).

```
$ python scripts/get_palette.py
```

This will do the following (by default):
- Obtain a 10-length colour palette and store it as [`results/palette_rgb_codes.csv`](results/palette_rgb_codes.csv).
- Generate the colour palette. Saves image as [`results/palette.png`](results/palette.png)
- Generate the colour palette bar plot, illustrating presence rate. Saves image as [`results/palette_proportion.png`](results/palette_proportion.png)

### Others

#### Some stats (post's date occurence)
Use the script [`get_stats.py`](scripts/get_stats.py).

```
$ python scripts/get_stats.py
```

By default, it saves results as [`results/stats_dates.csv`](results/stats_dates.csv)
